# ngx-starter
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).
It provides a foundation on which to build custom applications that share common features and functionality.
Towards this goal, it provides common and reusable utilities.
In addition, it provices a reference application that demonstrates conventions and best practices.

This application tries to adhere to the [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide).
The basic project structure is established by [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).
This documentation will only discuss aspects that are unique to it.

## Development

### NPM Scripts

This starter application provides a number of NPM tools for ease of development. Following sections go into further detail on some of these scripts:

npm run ... | Description
--- | ---
ng | Enters the Angular CLI.
start | Start the app for development that will rebuild and reload as you change files.
start:prod | Start the app for production by building assets into, and serving them from, the `./dist` directory.
build | Runs a development build that will ensure all code compiles correctly.
build:prod | Runs a production build that will output assets into the `./dist` directory.
build:bundle-report | Builds for development and starts a Webpack Bundle Analyzer on local port 8888. Then, opens a browser to this port. Useful in identifying module optimizations.
test | Run karma tests with a watcher that will update as you change files.
test:ci | Runs karma tests once and outputs code coverage results upon successful execution.
lint | Runs the Angular CLI lint task (`ng lint`) and runs `stylelint` to lint scss files as configured by `stylelint.config.js`
lint:fix | Runs the lint task and stylelint with the `--fix` option. Will make corrections to files where able.
e2e | Runs end-to-end tests once and outputs test results to the console.

### Running the Development Server
`npm start` starts the development server.

This command will start the Angular.io application running in development mode.
It will run `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json`.

### Running the Development Server in Production Mode
`npm run start:prod` will run the development server in production mode.
This will run `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json --prod`.

### Tests
## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Proxy Config
When running the development server, all requests to `api/*` are proxied to `localhost:3000`.

### Proxy Config with PKI
To configure the development server for PKI mode, you can proxy the back-end requests through nginx.

To do this, configure nginx to listen on port 3000 and proxy requests through to your REST API.

You can configure nginx to hardcode append the `X-SSL-Client-S-DN` header for all requests so you don't actually have to use PKI in the browser. For example, the value of this header is configurable through the `proxyPkiPrimaryUserHeader` property in the [Node REST Starter API](https://github.com/Asymmetrik/node-rest-starter).

                proxy_redirect off;
                proxy_buffering off;

                # Http upgrade settings for websockets
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

                # Proxy settings for applications
                proxy_set_header X-ProxyScheme $scheme;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                proxy_set_header X-ProxyHost $host;
                proxy_set_header X-ProxyPort  443;
                proxy_set_header X-ProxyContextPath "";
        }
}
```
