<p class="lead">Teams play a critical role in the organization of and access to application resources.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
	Teams are used to manage the organization of and access to resources in the application.
	Each resource is 'owned' by a team, and only members of that team can view that resource.
</p>

<h2>Team Roles</h2>

	<label class="control-label">Team Editor</label>
	<p>This role grants the user the ability to create/edit/delete resources on behalf of the team.</p>
