	Teams play a critical role in the organization of and access to application resources.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
	Teams are used to manage the organization of and access to resources in the application. Each
	resource is 'owned' by a team, and only members of that team can view that resource.
</p>

<h2>Team Roles</h2>

<p>
	All team members receive basic 'read' access to team resources. Advanced access can be granted
	using the roles described below.
</p>

<div class="mb-3 site-mb-3">
	<h5>Team Admin</h5>
	<p>
		This role grants the user the ability to add/remove members of the team and to delete the
		team itself. Team admins will receive access requests generated from within the UI.
	</p>

	<h5>Team Editor</h5>
	<p>
		This role grants the user the ability to create/edit/delete resources on behalf of the team.
	</p>
